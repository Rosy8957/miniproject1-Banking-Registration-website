                <h1>****Become a Digital Banker****</h1>
                <img src="image/digital.jpg">
                <p class="par">Digital Banking is rthe automation of traditional banking services. Digital banking enables a bank’s customers to access banking products and services via an electronic/online platform. Digital banking means to digitize all of the banking operations and substitute the bank’s physical presence with an everlasting online presence, eliminating a consumer’s need to visit a branch.Advancing to a more technologically sophisticated way of doing things, it goes without saying that the benefits long outweigh the costs. 
                    Similarly, digital banking as a technological by-product aims to make life easier for the customers of a bank. Digital banking has the following benefits:
                    Digital banking enables consumers to perform banking functions from the comfort of their homes, be it an elderly person who is tired of waiting in lines or a working-class professional who is caught up with work, or a regular person who does not want to visit the bank’s branch to run a single errand. 
                    It also offers convenience.Elaborating on the convenience offered, digital banking lets a user carry out banking work around the clock, with 24*7 availability of access to banking functions.One of the biggest drawbacks of traditional banking was the overly placed importance on paper. 
                    Banking has become paperless with the development of digital banking as a service. A user can log into their account at any point in time to monitor records.Digital banking allows a user to set up automatic payments for regular utility bills such as electricity, gas, phone, and credit cards.</p>
